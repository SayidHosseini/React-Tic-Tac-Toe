# React Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first react project (game) and my sole intention was to play with materials I learned in the [React Quick Start guide](https://react.dev/learn).

## Possible Improvements

- I still don't know the first things in React (folder structure, proper component seperation, state management and most of the hooks) and there are a lot of rooms to improve in these areas.
- The whole project could be parametrized and the `findWinner` algorithm could be improved.
- Starting turn could be chosen randomly instead of fixed `X`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
